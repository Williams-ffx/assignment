      <h1>What is Coding?</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        Coding can be defined as a mechanical language that we use to interact
        or relate with the computer system
      </p>
      <h2>Frontend vs Backend</h2>

      <ul>
        Frontend is a part of coding where the end users relate to the website
        while backend is the backbone structure that forms up what should be
        displayed in the frontend
      </ul>
      <ul>
        Frontend is where the beauty of the website is shown while backend is
        the main structure of the website
      </ul>
      <ul>
        Frontend is the translative part of coding while backend is the
        commanding part of coding
      </ul>
      <h2>
